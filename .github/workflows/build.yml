    # The step below publishes to testpypi in order to catch any issues
    # with the package configuration that would cause a failure to upload
    # to pypi. One example of such a failure is if a classifier is
    # rejected by pypi (e.g "3 - Beta"). This would cause a failure during the
    # middle of the package upload causing the action to fail. If at the point
    # of failure some packages would have already been updated, this would be
    # bad as we'd have mismatching versions online.
